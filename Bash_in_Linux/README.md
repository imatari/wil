# Note
What I add to [`reference.md`](./reference.md) will be things I've learned as I go along my Linux journey.  
It will _not_ be exhaustive.

If after looking at my notes you find that  
* something could be made more clear _-or-_  
* that I've spoken incorrectly
please let me know : )  

Thanks!  

Now on to [**my learnings!**](./reference.md)
